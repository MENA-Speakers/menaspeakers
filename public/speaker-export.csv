Joy Ajlouny,"Joy Ajlouny: Co-founder of Fetchr
Businesswoman, motivational speaker ,serial entrepreneur and advisor, Joy Ajlouny is a flash-bang grenade thrown into the Middle East. Born and raised in California to Palestinian refugees, Ajlouny has built a reputation for her success in startups and ventures worldwide, all the while disrupting the status quo of women in buisness. Belonging to the top one percent of female entrepreneurs, the self-made entrepreneur has “gamified rejection” and carved her space in the business world. 
In 2015 Ajlouny co-founded Fetchr, the Silicon Valley-backed tech company that was created to tackle the Middle East’s “no address” issue, which has been long been a hindrance to growth in emerging markets. She facilitated $11 million in initial investments in Fetchr, as well as $41 million in a series B round in 2017. Having raised over $72 million,the company now successfully operates in five countries with a 4500-person staff, and was dubbed the number one startup in the Middle East by Forbes. In 2019, Ajlouny demonstrated that she was beholden to nobody when she resigned from her position at Fetchr, with plans to launch her third Silicon Valley-backed company later this year.
Ahead of founding Fetchr, Ajlouny was the driving force and sole entity behind the e-commerce luxury fashion platform Bonfaire. Acquired by Moda Operandi––a fashion e-commerce giant owned by LVMH and Condé Nast––in 2013, just two years after its launch, this was only the start of what would develop into a long-lasting relationship between Ajlouny and the fashion industry. Ajlouny is regularly hired as a consultant for fashion startups, as well as for venture capitalists
Over the last decade, her unmatched knowledge and expertise in funding and investment, startups and marketing strategies has compounded into what’s known as the “Joy effect,” a term that refers to the ripple of her influence on a multitude of new and once suffering companies. Considered an expert in emotional marketing, she follows the rule of thumb that in order to be successful, you have to “fall in love with your customer.” With less than three percent of venture capital funding raised by women, Ajlouny has successfully raised multiple rounds of funding for her two startups, acquiring investments from prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firms. 
As a self-made woman in the industry, Ajlouny is passionate about encouraging and investing knowledge into the young women of tomorrow. Ajlouny is regularly invited to speak at forums and events across the world and most recently took the stage at the World Economic Forum in Jordan and BoF VOICES in the UK. Her talks are not only centered upon her businesses, but on the realities of being a female entrepreneur, the double bind and the relentlessness it takes to secure a position that counters the traditional roles allocated for women.

HE President Thabo Mbeki,"<b>HE President Thabo Mbeki</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: HE President Thabo Mbeki</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Born at Idutywa in the Eastern Cape in June 1942, Thabo Mbeki sat for his Matriculation examinations at St John’s High School in Umtata in 1959, having been expelled from Lovedale High School earlier that year for participating in an anti-apartheid strike. He passed his British ‘A level’ examinations in 1961 as a SACHED student based in Johannesburg. This qualified him to enroll in 1962 at Sussex University in the UK where he graduated as a Master of Arts in Economics in 1966. He then worked at the ANC Office in London.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During 1969-70 he studied politics and trained as a military officer in the Soviet Union. He joined the ANC Youth League in 1956 and was elected Secretary General of the African Students Association in 1961. In 1971 in exile he joined the staff at ANC Headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia where he was co-opted into the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC in 1975 and then elected into the NEC at the 1985 ANC Conference. He served as Political Secretary to Oliver Tambo, then President of the ANC as well as Deputy Secretary of the Revolutionary Council; Head of the Departments of Information and International Affairs and from 1997 –1999 as ANC National Chairman.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He played an important role in facilitating contact between the ANC and the leadership inside South Africa, which emerged after the banning of the ANC and also led many of the ANC teams which facilitated the process leading to the 1990-94 negotiations which ended apartheid rule.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">President Nelson Mandela appointed him as his Deputy President for the duration of the period of the first democratic government of 1994-99 where after he was elected President of South Africa and served in this position until he resigned in 2008.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As President of the Republic he presided over the longest period of economic growth in South Africa since the Second World War; championed poverty reduction programmes and the deracialisation of the South African economy. He vigorously encouraged women’s empowerment, gender equality and national unity to advance the objectives of the South African Constitution. He led the campaign of the South African government and the national Soccer leadership which persuaded FIFA in 2004 to resolve that the 2010 Soccer World Cup should take place in South Africa and therefore for the first time in Africa.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 2002, he served as the founding Chairperson of the African Union within which he pioneered the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); initiated the establishment of the IBSA (India, Brazil, South Africa) Dialogue Forum and served as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement. He spearheaded the process, which placed Africa’s challenges firmly on the global agenda thus positioning South Africa as an important global player, and having successfully helped to establish the vision of an African Renaissance as a uniting African objective.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mr. Mbeki contributed to and led many of Africa’s initiatives to end various conflicts. These included those in Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Burundi, and Comoros. Since his retirement, he has, at the request of the AU, led two Panels mandated to help Sudan to resolve its various challenges.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 2010 he established the Thabo Mbeki Foundation and the Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute focused on the achievement of the goals of the African Renaissance. Thabo Mbeki is recognised throughout Africa and elsewhere in the world as a thought leader whose profile as an intellectual, a policy maker and a mediator has been built over a lifetime. He has won many awards to acknowledge his contribution to human advancement.</span>

Dr Van Rijmenam knows how technologies impact organizations and society. He advises organizations on building a data organization, which offers a lot of opportunities, but also comes with significant responsibilities in terms

of security, ethics and privacy.

He is the publisher of the ‘f(x) = e^x‘ newsletter, read by thousands of executives, on the future of work and the organization of tomorrow. The Digital Speaker has spoken in 20 countries across the globe and collectively inspired over 100.000 managers, directors, and C-level executives.

</div>
Dr Mark van Rijmenam is available as an avatar, hologram, a combination of both or for in-person keynotes. His (virtual) keynotes focus on the future of work, the digital employee and how to build the organisation of tomorrow using emerging technologies such as big data, blockchain, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. As The Digital Speaker, he believes that every organisation is a data organisation. In his talks, he discusses the importance of data security, data governance and data privacy to help organisations understand how to build a customer-centric business using emerging technologies. The Digital Speaker’s (virtual) keynotes are targeted at organisations who understand they have to digitally transform their business but who do not yet know where to start and want to learn how to remain competitive in a digital world. His presentations are ideally suited as an inspirational opening keynote to give everyone a shared understanding of emerging technologies and how they will change the future of work and impact tomorrow’s organisation. This will help set the scene for more in-depth keynotes and break-out sessions later during an event.

Bethenny Frankel,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bethenny Frankel is an entrepreneur speaker, reality TV star, bestselling author, and the founder of Skinnygirl Cocktails. While starring on Bravo’s The Real Housewives of New York City, Frankel single-handedly created the low-calorie cocktail category with the launch of her Skinnygirl Cocktails. She has been named one of the Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities by Forbes magazine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has had five New York Times bestselling books, including Skinnydipping and A Place of Yes: 10 Rules for Getting Everything You Want Out Of Life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bethenny Frankel is a self-made businesswoman, TV producer, multiple New York Times bestselling author, and mother. Bethenny recently made a multi-year deal with MGM Television and Mark Burnett to generate unscripted television projects that she will produce, representing the shift in the conversation for women. She is the Founder &amp; CEO of Skinnygirl, a lifestyle brand offering practical solutions to women, including the recent launch of the Skinnygirl Jeanswear Collection, which sold out on HSN within its first few hours. Bethenny can be seen as a guest shark on ABC’s critically acclaimed series “Shark Tank.” She became an instant fan favorite, showcasing her entrepreneurial prowess and gut instincts alongside the panel of investors. Bethenny recently left the popular Bravo series “The Real Housewives of New York City,” after eleven seasons to focus more on her daughter, her philanthropy, and her partnership with Mark Burnett. Bethenny has also been named one of the Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities by Forbes. Bethenny is always ahead of the curve and identifies and capitalizes on business opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not fulfilled by business alone, Bethenny’s life’s experiences have inspired her to help other women find their own strength and resilience with the launch of B Strong, in partnership with Dress for Success. B Strong: Find Your Yes, is a real-time, emergency intervention initiative that provides assistance to women who face crises on their road to success.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, Bethenny established the worldwide initiative, “B Strong: Disaster Relief.” Their program provides people with much needed gift cards, bank cards and critical supplies so they are able to deliver in real time.&nbsp; They collect aid and donations from across the country to help individuals and their families affected by the recent natural disasters impacting Texas, Florida, Mexico, Northern California, Dominica, The U.S. Virgin Islands and New York City. As a result of Bethenny’s efforts, B Strong had marshaled over 10 million pounds of aid that was destined primarily for Puerto Rico. Bethenny helped coordinate the chartering of 55+ private planes to help deliver aid and relief to those hit hardest by the disaster. Raising approximately $1.25 million in cash cards and collecting over $20 million worth of disaster relief to distribute, this has been called one of the largest privately-run humanitarian efforts in US history. B Strong has also supported immediate aid programs in Guatemala following the Volcano De Fuego eruption, North Carolina following Hurricane Florence, Florida Panhandle following Hurricane Michael and most recently in the Bahamas after the devastating effects of Hurricane Dorian. Over 10,000 individuals, companies and foundations have contributed to B Strong’s efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a runner up on “The Apprentice: Martha Stewart,” her success then led her to Bravo’s “The Real Housewives of New York City,” followed by the spin-off series, “Bethenny Getting Married?” and “Bethenny Ever After…” Viewers were captivated by her wit, wisdom and humor as they followed her personal life becoming a mother and her professional journey creating the Skinnygirl empire. She eventually brought her distinct voice and candid point of view to “Bethenny,” where she hosted her nationally syndicated daytime talk show program. Bethenny started her own TV production company, B Real-ity, producing two seasons of FYI’s “Food Porn,” and was the creator, producer and star of Bravo’s hit real estate show “Bethenny and Fredrik.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From becoming a natural food chef and marketing Bethenny Bakes, her healthy baked goods service, to selling “Princess Pashminas” at house parties and creating the low-calorie cocktail category with the launch of Skinnygirl Cocktails, Bethenny has always identified and capitalized on business opportunities. A true entrepreneur, to further build Skinnygirl Cocktails, Bethenny partnered with Beam Suntory in 2011 to grow her portfolio to include wines, flavored vodkas, and ready-to-drink cocktails. Since the launch of Skinnygirl Cocktails, she has expanded the Skinnygirl brand into a global lifestyle empire, featuring products for women that offer practical and stylish solutions to everyday problems. With the launch of the Skinnygirl Jeanswear collection in September 2018, Skinnygirl has become more than a brand, but also an attitude that helps empower women to lead healthy lives and feel strong, honest and fearless. Some of the many other Skinnygirl products include microwave popcorn, candy, salad dressings, coffee, tea, liquid sweeteners, water enhancers, shapewear, and most recently candles, skin and body care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re good with your hands, but your brother is more intelligent…” was something Tom was told often as a child. Having failed his 11+ exam and consigned to being ‘average’, he is living proof that anyone can be who they want to be and achieve a destiny beyond their dreams, exceeding the low expectation of others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Training with the Neuroleadership Institute, Tom is an accredited brain and behaviour specialist, using applied neuroscience research and tried-and-tested techniques to motivate and transform. He has formulated a series of world-renowned seminars, delivered to multinational businesses, including HSBC, Louis Vuitton, Emirates, Siemens, Unilever and the BBC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through interaction, real-world examples and scientific explanation, Tom’s talks explain the limiting beliefs and fixed mindsets that inhibits the potential of so many. He explains the brain’s ability to rewire in order to make an everlasting change in behaviours.</p>

<p>Neuroscience explains why so much of our behaviour is based on emotion and why despite our best endeavours we often fall short of the results we want. With even a basic understanding of how the brain works, neuroscience answers the question ‘why should I behave like this and not like that’. When we understand why, this drives real behaviour change and a desire to truly embrace new ideas to deliver success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tom’s interactive delivery is based on sound principles to ensure the ideas sticks, so planting the seeds of change. You will witness an exciting and immediate impact. Your people will&nbsp;start to think and act differently.</p>

<p>In 2012, she decided to turn her passion into a career and became a full-time athlete. Within the same year, her hard work and dedication paid off when she made history for becoming the first Arab woman to compete in the Reebok Crossfit Asia Regionals in Seoul, South Korea. By 2013, Amna broke even more barriers for Arab women by competing internationally and becoming the first competitive Weightlifter from the Gulf to do so in Hijab. Having competed in the Arnold Sport festival in Ohio and several other international events, in 2015 she won 6 gold medals and 3 silver medals at the IWF Asian Interclub Championships in Jordan. In 2016, Amna decided to realize her dream of participating at the Olympics in Rio. She set out to join her fellow UAE team members in competing at the Asian Championships Olympics qualifier in Uzbekistan. Despite her injuries, Amna persevered and her participation led to the UAE team gaining more qualifying points. These points were a defining factor in the UAE weightlifting team making it through to Rio. Amna was not able to continue the journey due to her injuries.</p>

In 2016, she became the first Arab athlete invited to visit Nike HQ in Portland, Oregon to consult on challenges faced by Arab athletes and their needs, which then inspired the development of the Nike Pro Hijab. Amna has shared her story on CNN in hopes of inspiring more women to pursue their passion, whichever field that may be in. She was also featured in The Washington Post, New York Times and Forbes Middle East.</p>

Debbie Nicol,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Debbie Nicol, an Australian accomplished business professional, personifies change.&nbsp; With true conviction and consistent commitment to learning and developing human capability in organizations, Debbie has change, leadership and learning at the core of all that she has accomplished.&nbsp; The name ‘Debbie Nicol’ is synonymous with quality, results and impact’!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Debbie’s career has spanned 5 continents over 25 years, Australia, Asia, Middle East, Europe and UK, while holding local, regional and global corporate Leadership, HR, OD, Change and Learning roles.&nbsp; Initially a teacher in the Australian public education system, the pull of industry became all too strong, at which stage Debbie entered the world of International Hospitality. This led her from a position in one hotel to a corporate HR Development role overseeing 600 properties. Thereafter, the only growth possible was to become an entrepreneur, a move that has resulted in vast learning, serving many industries such as Oil and Gas, Logistics and Shipping, Pharmaceuticals, Retail, Telecoms, Knowledge Security and Government arenas, across the GCC region and west Asia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These achievements have been founded on her solid and consistent commitment to self-learning. Debbie firstly gained a Diploma of Teaching in Australia; she openly admits it was one of the best foundations for success, providing organizational skills for both content and people management. Moving on, she ventured into exploring Human Resources with a Diploma of HR, which most certainly opened her mind to the corporate side of learning. Struck by the ‘social constructivist’ method of learning, she ventured into a Masters of Education, through a community-based online learning methodology, revered for pioneering education in Australia and loved it so much that she continued to complete an additional Masters Degree of Applied Linguistics.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Debbie thrives in life with a strong vibrant spirit.&nbsp; Constantly ‘on the go’ in both work and life, she stretches herself with travels that take her to an edge. Surviving on a sled in the Arctic for 9 days, trekking Mont Blanc in Europe and sea-caving in Cyprus are but some of the sports you’ll hear her refer to with glee – and yes, each and every one of them teaches her something as well!&nbsp; Ever the learner, she personifies the belief: through training we learn, and afterall, aren’t the best learners the best leaders!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Debbie has authored four leadership books, created a leadership model for the changing world and is a regular columnist for ‘The National’ newspaper, with a monthly Leadership and Change column.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a cosmopolitan worldview shaped by her multicultural upbringing having been born in the US and raised in Saudi Arabia. Her affection for media is only equaled by her passion for humanitarian work. Embarking on a mission, she joined the American Red Cross in 2000 as assistant deputy director of financial development in Houston Texas, using her leadership, communication and commercial acumen to reach out to benefactors and philanthropists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2004, she returned to her Middle Eastern heritage, securing a role as senior project manager at the Dubai-based Arab Media Group. Among several groundbreaking accomplishments across different media platforms were helping spearhead the launch of several Dubai brands some including Awraq publishing, Done Events and some new radio stations for the ARN radio giant. She was also part of the launch team of MTV and served as channel manager for Nickelodeon Arabia Children’s Channel. Such achievements caught the eye of the Abu Dhabi Media Company, and soon went to head up a number of strategic project-based initiatives for the industry heavyweight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More recently she has cultivated yet more forms of expression, by diversifying into ‘new media’ with leading Emirati integrated agency Alsayegh Media. As head of their Abu Dhabi office, she was able to transform an early stage startup into a multi-million dollar revenue-generating agency. Subsequently promoted to Managing Director and focusing on strategic operations for the Dubai and Abu Dhabi offices, she was part of the team responsible for the agency’s emergence as one of the premier innovators in digital media.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In January 2016, she decided to take her years of experience and expertise and combine them with her advanced coaching accreditation to launch her own company (Leila Almaeena Coaching &amp; Consulting) which focuses its importance on wellness in the workplace. It is in this space that she is adding the most value by creating tools that will help company leaders increase wellness, job satisfaction and personal development amongst their workforce, thus improving morale and bottom line simultaneously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An ardent explorer of the world, she is particularly passionate about discovering little known adventures and hidden gem destinations and off-the-beaten-track adventures.

Terence Mauri,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The future has already happened. We live in an age of wonder – cars that drive themselves, platforms that anticipate our needs, and robots capable of everything from advanced manufacturing to complex surgery. Automation, algorithms and AI are transforming not only business but also every facet of leadership. While many fear that robots will take their jobs, the rise of exponential technologies begs a bigger question: how do you continue to reinvent today while creating tomorrow?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&lt;strong&gt;Own The Future&lt;/strong&gt;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Terence Mauri’s keynotes act as a catalyst for reinvention. He combines curiosity, deep research and real-world analysis for understanding the future of organizations today. Terence addresses the mindsets organisations must embrace in order to thrive in the future: courage, clarity, curiosity, and conviction. Without them, organisations will fail. Building on lessons from diverse companies such as Goldman Sachs, Ant Financial (Alibaba), Starling Bank, JP Morgan, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft, leaders are inspired to create the next best version of themselves, allowing them to own the future rather than be disrupted by it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&lt;strong&gt;SURVIVE OR THRIVE IN THE AGE OF AI&lt;/strong&gt; The future has already happened. We live in an age of wonder – cars that drive themselves, platforms that anticipate our needs, and robots capable of everything from advanced manufacturing to complex surgery. Automation, algorithms and AI are transforming not only business but also every facet of leadership. While many fear that robots will take their jobs, the rise of exponential technologies begs a bigger question: how do you continue to reinvent today while creating tomorrow?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&lt;strong&gt;D/SRUPTED&lt;/strong&gt; How do you change before a crisis forces you to? How do you turn disruptors into opportunites? Disruption is a hot topic in boardrooms around the world as executives seek to improve profitability, monetise data, and capture new market share. And as disruption enters the everyday workplace it’s important for leaders to recognise that disruptive change opens a window of opportunity to fundamentally change business as usual. Disruption presents much more than a technology challenge. It’s about rethinking the future and taking advantage of difficult to replicate assets without succumbing to the business as usual mindset. This presents a leadership challenge. Are you ready to lead disruption?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&lt;strong&gt;The Corporate Rebel&lt;/strong&gt; 'Most companies are simply not designed to survive. They become successful on the basis of one big idea or breakthrough product,' says Terence Mauri, author of the global best seller The Leader’s Mindset: How To Win In The Age of Disruption. 'The companies that will thrive in the near future are the ones not only embracing change but breaking the rules.' In this dynamic talk, Terence delivers the immersion and the excitement that is often necessary to truly futurize your organisation, and to challenge and change established mindsets, toxic assumptions or satisfied attitudes. How can you get ready for this kind of VUCA future and reposition today’s business while creating the future?</p>

Dr. Mohamed Ghoneim,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1983, Prof. Ghoneim founded the Urology and Nephrology Center (UNC) - WHO Collaborating Centre, for Management of Renal and Urological Disorders in Mansoura, Egypt. This Center of excellence, established within the Mansoura University Hospital, is dedicated for surgical and medical treatment of genito-urinary disorders. At present, the UNC provides care to tens of thousands of patients, for the vast majority of them, free-of-charge, and education and training to hundreds of nurses and physicians from around the world. The success of the UNC is a tribute to the personal commitment and sustained effort of Ghoneim. Information at UNC is now approximately 85% digital, enabling physicians to access and review patients' diagnostic images and information electronically and to make quick and sound healthcare decisions. To enable this, Ghoneim recruited computer scientists from the University of Cairo, engineers from General Electric and members of his own faculty to collaborate, and build a system that works as well for the doctor in the clinic and the surgeon in the operating room as it does for the professor or statistician in the office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ghoneim is a world leader in kidney transplantation. The UNC carried out the first renal transplant in Egypt in the year 1976. The number of transplants carried out to date at the Centre is more than 2000, making it one of the leading Centers for renal transplants in the Middle East. Ghoneim is also an international expert in general and specialized urology operations, prostate diseases, tumours of the genito-urinary system, renal stone operations, correction of congenital anomalies and urological endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery. He carried out several studies on bladder carcinoma resulting from Bilharzial infestation; an endemic problem in Egypt. He also introduced several novel surgical techniques for bladder replacement by intestines following its removal for cancer. In addition, Ghoneim has been heavily involved in basic research. Currently, studies are being carried out at the Centre aiming for the treatment of diabetes by the utilization of stem cells.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prof. Ghoneim has published more than 14 books or book chapters on medical oncology, bladder cancer, and other topics in urology. He has published more than 130 original articles in national and international journals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2010, Ghoneim started the International Training Course on “Techniques in Reconstructive Urology”, which provides hands-on training and practice for common reconstructive urological techniques. Prof. Mohamed Ghoneim went to Gaza during the winter of 2008–2009 to help in providing medical services to casualties of the Gaza War.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Awards and Recognition:</p>
